# Train Brain Game: Framework-Agnostic Architecture

Based on the available information, I'll describe how the Train Brain Game works in an abstract way that can be implemented in any framework like React, without specific ties to Godot.

## Core Application Components

### 1. Data Models

**Results Data Model**
```javascript
// Result object structure
{
  date: String, // ISO format date string (e.g., "2025-04-13T17:37:43")
  time: Number  // Completion time in seconds
}
```

### 2. Application Screens

**Home Screen**
- Entry point of the application
- Contains navigation to other screens:
  - Start Math Drill button
  - View Statistics button
  - Settings button (optional)

**Math Drill Screen**
- Main gameplay screen
- Components:
  - Problem display area
  - User input area
  - Timer display
  - Progress indicator

**Results Screen**
- Displays performance after completing a drill
- Components:
  - Time taken
  - Star rating based on performance
  - Options to retry or return home

**Statistics Screen**
- Visualizes user performance over time
- Components:
  - Line chart showing completion times
  - Histogram of time distribution
  - Performance trends

### 3. Core Services

**Problem Generator Service**
- Generates math problems based on difficulty settings
- Validates user answers
- Tracks correct/incorrect responses

**Timer Service**
- Manages countdown or elapsed time
- Formats time for display
- Provides hooks for time-based events

**Results Service**
- Saves performance data to storage
- Retrieves historical results
- Calculates performance metrics

**Statistics Service**
- Processes raw results data
- Generates visualization data
- Calculates trends and improvements

### 4. State Management

**Application State**
- Current screen
- User settings
- Active drill configuration

**Drill State**
- Current problem
- User input
- Timer state
- Correct/incorrect count

**Results State**
- Latest performance data
- Historical performance data

## Application Lifecycle

### 1. Initialization

1. Load application configuration
2. Initialize services
3. Load saved user preferences
4. Render home screen

### 2. Starting a Drill

1. User selects "Start Drill" from home screen
2. Application loads drill configuration
3. Problem generator creates first problem
4. Timer starts
5. Render math drill screen

### 3. During Drill

1. Display current problem
2. Accept user input
3. Validate answer:
   - If correct, generate next problem
   - If incorrect, provide feedback (optional)
4. Update progress indicator
5. Continue until drill completion criteria met

### 4. Completing a Drill

1. Stop timer
2. Calculate performance metrics
3. Save result to storage:
   ```javascript
   {
     date: new Date().toISOString(),
     time: elapsedTimeInSeconds
   }
   ```
4. Render results screen with performance summary

### 5. Viewing Statistics

1. Load all results from storage
2. Process data for visualization
3. Generate charts:
   - Line chart of completion times over dates
   - Histogram showing distribution of times
4. Render statistics screen with visualizations

### State Management Options

1. **React Context + Hooks**: For simpler applications
2. **Redux**: For more complex state management
3. **MobX**: For reactive state management

### Data Persistence

1. **LocalStorage**: Simple client-side storage
2. **IndexedDB**: More robust client-side database
3. **Firebase**: Cloud-based storage for multi-device sync

### Visualization Libraries

1. **Chart.js**: Simple, responsive charts
2. **D3.js**: Advanced, customizable visualizations
3. **Recharts**: React-specific charting library

## Key Features to Implement

1. **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
2. **Offline Support**: Functions without internet connection
3. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
4. **Performance Optimization**: Fast problem generation and validation
5. **Animations**: Smooth transitions between screens and problems

By following this architecture, you can implement the Train Brain Game in React or any other framework while maintaining the core functionality and user experience of the original application.
