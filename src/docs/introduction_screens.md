# Best paractices for designing user onboarding

## What Are Onboarding Screens?

Onboarding screens (also called welcome screens) are the first interactive experiences users encounter when opening an app for the first time. They guide users through initial setup, introduce key features, and help establish the app's value proposition.

## Examples from Popular Apps

### Duolingo's Approach
Duolingo uses a friendly mascot (Duo the owl) to welcome new users, then asks them to set language learning goals and motivations. Their onboarding flow includes language selection, goal setting, and permission granting to personalize the learning experience.

### Key Elements from Top Apps
Apps like Duolingo, Fastic, and Blinkist excel at onboarding by asking lots of questions, using well-designed interactive UI, and providing personalized prompts and recommendations.

## Best Practices for Onboarding Screen Design

### 1. **Keep It Short and Focused**
Avoid lengthy tutorials showing every button - users want to get started quickly, not read a manual. Focus on essential features that drive immediate value.

### 2. **Prioritize Value Discovery**
Show users exactly why your app matters to them right from the start, guide them to their "aha" moment as quickly as possible, and reduce time to value.

### 3. **Minimize Friction in Signup**
Enable social logins (Google, Apple, social accounts) and offer one-tap signup to reduce friction completely. Mobile users especially expect speed and won't waste time with long forms.

### 4. **Focus on User-Centricity**
Understanding your target audience is core to successful onboarding - get inside the heads of your ideal users, not just demographics.

### 5. **Drive Key Actions Early**
Design onboarding to get users to perform actions that increase initial engagement and retention. For example, a weight loss app might prioritize getting users to log their current weight.

### 6. **Optimize Every Screen**
Apps like SoundCloud optimize every single onboarding screen, and you can use heatmaps to see where users interact most.

### 7. **Use Progressive Disclosure**
Don't ask for all permissions upfront. Apps that request camera, microphone, location, and contacts access before showing value create unnecessary friction.

### 8. **Personalization Through Questions**
Following Duolingo's model, ask strategic questions early to personalize the experience and increase user investment in the app.

### 9. **Visual Design Principles**
- Use clear, engaging visuals and animations
- Maintain consistent branding
- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast
- Design for different screen sizes

### 10. **Test and Iterate**
Successful app developers reverse engineer success stories from other companies and closely observe how users interact with their app to create engaging onboarding experiences.

The key is balancing information gathering with immediate value delivery, ensuring users understand your app's benefit before asking them to invest time or provide personal information.

# Design of Onboarding Screens

The proposed screen design represents a **system of onboarding screens for an application** based on Ryuta Kawashima's "Japanese System for Developing Intelligence and Memory." These screens are designed to introduce users to the methodology, explain its principles, and prepare them to begin training.

The design includes eight sequential screens, each with its own title, text description, and design elements:

1. **Screen 1: Welcome and Introduction**
   * **Screen Title:** Welcome! Develop Your Brain with the Japanese Method.
   * **Text:** Welcomes the user to the application and emphasizes that the brain is capable of development at any age. Professor Ryuta Kawashima's methodology is aimed at **active stimulation of the prefrontal cortex** to improve intelligence and memory. Daily short training sessions can prevent age-related brain changes and improve mental functions.
   * **Design Elements:** Includes an attractive headline, motivating text, brain activity imagery, and a "Next" button.

2. **Screen 2: Daily Tasks**
   * **Screen Title:** Daily Training: Arithmetic Problems.
   * **Text:** Explains that the user will solve blocks of simple arithmetic examples (addition, subtraction, multiplication). **The key goal is to perform tasks as quickly as possible** for maximum activation of the prefrontal cortex. This part of training takes only a few minutes per day but requires consistency.
   * **Design Elements:** Headline, examples of arithmetic tasks with answer fields, brief instructions, and a "Next" button.

3. **Screen 3: Weekly Tests Overview**
   * **Screen Title:** Weekly Assessment: Your Progress.
   * **Text:** Informs about comprehensive weekly assessment to measure prefrontal cortex condition and track progress. The assessment consists of three tests: **Counting Test**, **Word Memory Test**, and **Stroop Test**.
   * **Design Elements:** Headline and three interactive cards or icons representing each test (e.g., numbers and stopwatch for counting test, book with words for word memory, colorful words for Stroop test).

4. **Screen 4: Initial Assessment (Test 1/3: Counting Test)**
   * **Screen Title:** Initial Assessment: Counting Test.
   * **Text:** Describes the first test of initial assessment, where the user's task is to **count aloud from 1 to 120 as quickly as possible**. The application automatically measures time.
   * **Design Elements:** Headline, subtitle (1/3), large timer, animated counting text or "Start Counting" button, and "Start Test" button.

5. **Screen 5: Initial Assessment (Test 2/3: Word Memory Test)**
   * **Screen Title:** Initial Assessment: Word Memory Test.
   * **Text:** Instructs the user to memorize as many words as possible from a list within **two minutes**. After time expires, empty fields are provided for recording remembered words. Sources show examples of such word lists on pages 20 and 173.
   * **Design Elements:** Headline, subtitle (2/3), grid of 30 words with countdown timer, and "Next" button.

6. **Screen 6: Initial Assessment (Test 3/3: Stroop Test)**
   * **Screen Title:** Initial Assessment: Stroop Test.
   * **Text:** Explains the final assessment test aimed at checking attention and reaction speed. The task is to **quickly name the COLOR of the font while ignoring the word's meaning**. An example is given: if the word "RED" is written in blue color, the correct answer is "BLUE." Users are recommended to minimize errors and execution time. Examples of the Stroop test are presented in sources, for example, on page 175.
   * **Design Elements:** Headline, subtitle (3/3), Stroop test example, instructions with key word highlighting, color selection buttons or voice input capability, and "Start Stroop Test" button.

7. **Screen 7: Progress Tracking**
   * **Screen Title:** Track Your Progress and Achievements.
   * **Text:** Emphasizes that the application will save **daily results of arithmetic tasks (time spent)** and **weekly results of all tests**. Progress will be displayed with visual graphs. The **importance of consistency** in training is emphasized, even with just a few minutes per day available. It's noted that each result is unique, and the main thing is personal growth. Sources contain examples of tables and graphs for tracking results.
   * **Design Elements:** Headline, infographics or simplified graph demonstrating improvement in metrics, and "Next" button.

8. **Screen 8: Ready to Start!**
   * **Screen Title:** Begin Your Journey to a Sharp Mind!
   * **Text:** Encourages the user to start the **60-day program** for developing intelligence and memory. Motivates training by pointing out that it doesn't require much time but brings great benefits.
   * **Design Elements:** Action-calling headline, motivating concluding text, and large "Start Training" button.

Overall, the screen design is developed to **smoothly introduce users to Ryuta Kawashima's program**, explain its benefits, describe each type of training and test in detail, and show the importance of tracking progress and consistency for achieving results. The use of visual elements and clear instructions should make the process understandable and motivating.

## Additional Information

Solving simple arithmetic problems is considered one of the most effective ways to train the brain due to its unique impact on brain activity. Professor Ryuta Kawashima, after more than 20 years of research, concluded that solving simple arithmetic examples against time is the best way to stimulate human brain function.

The effectiveness of this methodology is due to the following reasons:

1. **Comprehensive activation of the prefrontal cortex**: Research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed that when solving simple arithmetic examples performed for speed, there is intensive increase in cerebral blood flow in extensive areas of both brain hemispheres. In particular, the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for such important functions as thinking, memory, and concentration, is actively stimulated. At the same time, when solving complex arithmetic problems, only the posterior part of the temporal and inferior parietal lobes of the cortex are activated, while the right hemisphere remains passive.

2. **Engagement of various brain zones**: When a person solves simple arithmetic examples, the frontal lobes (responsible for thinking and will), temporal lobes (responsible for memory), and parietal lobes (responsible for reasoning, understanding word meanings, conditional designations, number recognition, memory retrieval) work actively. Such comprehensive activation makes these exercises very productive.

3. **Ignoring errors in favor of speed**: The method emphasizes the importance of performing tasks as quickly as possible rather than striving for absolutely error-free solutions. This ensures maximum activation of the prefrontal cortex, as the brain is forced to work at maximum speed. If a person hesitates trying to perform the task perfectly, brain activation decreases.

4. **Daily and consistent impact**: Kawashima's program involves daily short training sessions lasting only a few minutes. Such consistency is key to success and allows prevention of age-related brain changes and improvement of mental functions.

5. **Advantage over other activities**:
   * Compared to reading aloud, which also activates both prefrontal lobes, solving arithmetic examples against time showed much more intensive activation.
   * Solving complex examples, as already mentioned, activates fewer brain areas and leaves the right hemisphere passive, making them less effective for overall stimulation.
   * Simple arithmetic tasks thus make the brain work most efficiently, stimulating it as strongly as possible in a short period of time.

Therefore, speed-solving simple arithmetic problems provides maximum and most extensive activation of the prefrontal cortex, making this method extremely effective for developing intelligence and memory.
